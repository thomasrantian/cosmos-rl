Welcome to cosmos-rl’s documentation!
==============================================

cosmos-rl is fully compatible with PyTorch and is designed for the future of distributed training.

Main Features
-------------
- **Natively Designed for Physical AI**
   - Cosmos-RL supports training serveral physical AI paradigms, e.g., LLM/VLM, world foundational models, VLA, etc.
   - **Multi-training Algorithms**
         - Supports state-of-the-art LLM RL algorithms (e.g., GRPO, DAPO, etc.), RL algorithms for world foundational models (e.g., FlowGRPO, DDRL, DiffusionNFT, etc.), and VLA-specific algorithms.
         - Well-architected design ensures high extensibility, requiring only minimal configuration to implement custom training algorithms.
   - **Diversified Model Support**
         - For LLM/VLM:
            - Natively supports LLaMA/Qwen/Qwen-VL/Qwen3-MoE series models.
            - Compatible with all Huggingface LLMs.
         - For world foundational models:
            - Natively supports SD3/Cosmos-Predict2.5/SANA.
            - Compatible with mainstream Huggingface world foundational models based on diffusers.
         - For VLA (Vision-Language-Action):
            - Natively supports OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT, and PI0.5 series models.
            - Integrated with LIBERO and BEHAVIOR-1K simulators.
         - Easily extensible to other model architectures by customizing interface.
- **6D Parallelism**: Sequence, Tensor, Context, Pipeline, FSDP, DDP.

- **Elastic & Fault Tolerance**: A set of techniques to improve the robustness of distributed training.

- **Async RL**
   - **Flexible**
      - **Rollout** and **Policy** are decoupled into independent processes/GPUs.
      - No colocation of **Rollout** and **Policy** is required.
      - Number of **Rollout/Policy** instances can be scaled independently.
   - **Fast**
      - *IB/NVLink* are used for high-speed weight synchronization.
      - **Policy** training and **Rollout** weight synchronization are **PARALLELIZED**.
   - **Robust**
      - Support `AIPO <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24034>`_ for stable off-policy training.
      - Async/Sync strategy can be selected upon to user's choice.

.. note::
   6D Parallelism is fully supported by Policy Model.
   For Rollout Model, only Tensor Parallelism and Pipeline Parallelism are supported.
