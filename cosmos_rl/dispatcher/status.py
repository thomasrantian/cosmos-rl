    Weight sync after step N exists to ship the freshly trained weights to
    the rollouts so they generate the rollouts trained at step N+1.  On the
    **final** step there is no N+1, so the sync is never consumed -- and
    issuing it anyway (the old ``or step == total_steps`` "ending signal")
    raced rollout self-terminate at end-of-data: the policy's deferred final
    P2R landed after the recipient rollout had already drained + aborted,
    orphaning the P2R recv and wedging ``ncclCommAbort`` (see
    rollout_multirank_shutdown.md).

    So for non-validation runs we **never** sync on the final step; rollouts
    stop via the unified prompt-stream ``is_end`` path
    (``controller.get_batched_prompt`` forces ``is_end`` once training is
    finished, feeding the ``prompt_consume_end`` fast path), with the
    explicit ``StopCommand`` broadcast as the backstop for any rank that
    never observes ``is_end`` (e.g. one wedged on the weight-version gate).

    Validation-enabled runs are the exception: the final/periodic validation
    is driven by the controller R2R broadcast and the rollout needs the
    synced weights to run it, so the last-step sync is kept (mirrored by the
    validation gating in the ``trigger_weight_sync`` exclusion and the STOP
    broadcast suppression).

    STOP is the NCCL-free, authoritative end-of-job signal for the rollouts
    (see :class:`~cosmos_rl.dispatcher.command.StopCommand`).  It must fire
    exactly once, at the moment the policy side is genuinely done:

    - ``n_policy == 0`` **and** ``had_policy_replicas``: every policy replica
      has unregistered after finishing its main loop (or been reaped).  A
      bare ``n_policy == 0`` at cold start -- before any policy has been
      seen -- must not trigger it.
    - ``training_finished`` **or** ``all_rollouts_ended``: distinguishes
      genuine end-of-job from a transient ``n_policy == 0`` during dynamic
      policy rescaling (scale-to-zero / rolling restart,
      ``current_step < total_steps``), where stopping the rollouts would be
      wrong.  ``all_rollouts_ended`` covers the post-``is_end`` case where
      the buffer-only recompute still leaves ``total_steps > current_step``
      (untrained buffer backlog the policy will never drain) so
      ``training_finished()`` is false even though the policy has already
      unregistered -- without this OR-guard STOP never fires and rollouts
      wedge (the GRPO end-of-data failure in CI).
    - ``not validation_enabled``: validation runs keep the final weight sync
      and stop via the R2R ``replica_should_stop`` broadcast instead, so STOP
      would race that path.
    - ``not stop_broadcast_sent``: one-shot; once sent we never re-broadcast.

    The caller still decides separately whether any rollout replicas remain
    to receive it; this is purely the "are we at the stop point?" gate.

    not yet adopted it -- i.e. ``last_staged_step > max_adopted_version``
    (``max_adopted_version`` is the freshest weight version any rollout has
    generated with, tracked from the stamped ``rollout.weight_version``).
    Issuing another round while one is in flight would only pile redundant
    ~1.6 GB transfers onto the rollout's ``WeightSyncThread`` queue -- every
    intermediate version is superseded before it is ever adopted (the rollout's
    ``sync_buffer_to_live`` always jumps to the latest ``buf_ver``).  So we skip;
    once the rollouts catch up the next tick issues at ``current_step`` (the
    latest) -> drop-to-latest.

    Note "in flight" is *derived*, not tracked: there is exactly one source of
    truth (the adopted-version comparison), so no counter can drift.

    ``forced`` overrides the skip for the one round that must never be coalesced
    away: a validation-trigger step, where the rollout needs that exact version
    to validate.  (The first sync issues naturally -- ``last_staged_step`` starts
    at -1, so the comparison is false -- and the staleness ceiling is enforced
    independently by ``filter_outdated_rollouts``.)
